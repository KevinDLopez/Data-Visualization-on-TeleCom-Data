# Data Visualization on Telecom Customer Data

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing telecom customer data to understand patterns related to customer churn, demographics, and other key metrics. The visualizations aim to provide insights into customer behavior and potential factors influencing churn.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following datasets located in the `data/` directory:

*   `telecom_customer_churn.csv`: Contains detailed customer-level information, including demographics, services subscribed to, and churn status.
*   `telecom_data_dictionary.csv`: Provides definitions for the columns present in the customer churn dataset.
*   `telecom_zipcode_population.csv`: Contains population data based on zip codes, which can be linked to customer locations.

## Visualizations

The project includes several dashboards and data stories created to explore the dataset.

### Dashboards

The dashboards provide interactive views of various aspects of the customer data, such as churn rates by different segments, service usage patterns, and geographic distributions.
